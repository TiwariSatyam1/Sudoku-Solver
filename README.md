# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a Sudoku generator and solver implemented in Java. It consists of two main components: a Sudoku board generator and a solver. The generator randomly generates valid Sudoku boards of varying difficulties, while the solver uses backtracking and other techniques to find a solution to a given Sudoku board.
